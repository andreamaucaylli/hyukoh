		 <p>Hyukoh (Korean: 혁오) is a South Korean indie band signed to HIGHGRND. Officially formed in May 2014, the band consists of Oh Hyuk, Im Dong-gun, Lim Hyun-jae, and Lee In-woo, all born in the year 1993. 	Due to both his parents being university professors, band frontman and founder Oh Hyuk lived in various cities across China (Jilin, Shenyang, and Beijing) before returning to Korea when he was 18 years old to study at Hongik University, where he started to pursue music full-time away from his parents' opposition. Hyukoh's music is predominantly in Korean and English, although Oh Hyuk has written songs in Chinese as well.</p>
